This is a collection of materials created by me for use as a Teaching Assistant. In some cases, the content created by me was a solution, and the original material (such as an exam) was created by someone else but is attached to the document. It should be clear by the quality and formatting when this is the case.

This collection showcases my ability to communicate and my dedication to performing a job well.
